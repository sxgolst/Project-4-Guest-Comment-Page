  <div class="question">
    <div class="question-title"> What does it mean to <b>assign</b> a value to a variable?  How do you do it?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

  </div>
  <div class="answer">
   <p>

                  The equal sign means an assignment like <span class="code"> my_variables = 5</span>  (5 take the place of <span class="code">my_variable</span>, sine it was declared)

                  Whereas <span class="code">2 + 3 = 5</span> is the mathematical equation
